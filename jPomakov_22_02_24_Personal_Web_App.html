        <p>Hi im James. I have lots of interests like sports, fashion, games and graphic design. The main sports I like are basketball and soccer as I have played in leagues for these sports but I can also pretty much play most sports like volleyball, badminton, hockey, baseball and football. Even though I like sports I also really like video games. The main types of games I play are sport games like 2k24 or FIFA and I also love fighting and story games like Yakuza, Spider Man and my favourite game Ghost of Tsushima. At this point in time I dont have any future goal that involve tech beside getting back into graphic design which I stopped doing because I got bored from it. My main goals though are to do a job I love and make a livable income while doing the job I love.</p>
