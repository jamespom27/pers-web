        <p>Hi im James. I have lots of interests like sports, fashion, games and graphic design. The main sports I like are basketball and soccer as I have played in leagues for these sports but I can also pretty much play most sports like volleyball, badminton, hockey, baseball and football. Even though I like sports I also really like video games. The main types of games I play are sport games like 2k24 or FIFA and I also love fighting and story games like Yakuza, Spider Man and my favourite game Ghost of Tsushima. At this point in time I dont have any future goal that involve tech beside getting back into graphic design which I stopped doing because I got bored from it. My main goals though are to do a job I love and make a livable income while doing the job I love. To the right are some of the graphic designs I have done.</p>

        <h2>Trivia App</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This trivia app was the very first app I ever created. It was a simple trivia game with around 10 questions that gave you points for ever correct. some of the wins me and my teammates got was creating a working app that worked on our very first try. I challenge that I believe we encountered was making the app look good as it was not very apealing.</p>  
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I created this app by using the terminal to ask questions where you can respond and answer. If the answer was correct I added a point to a variable that displayed how many point you got at the end. In the future I want to add more questions and just make the app look a lot more polished.</p>  
        </div>
        <h2>Fit Builder 9000</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This was the second app I ever create with my firends Ati and Matteo. This app was supposed to have users put in their clothes and create outfits with them on the app. The app was then supposed to tell them if their outfit was good or bad. The app never ened up fully working as I was only able to code some of the menus.</p>

        <p>I created this app by using j button and j frames. I created multiple menus so that when you click on a button it would open a new menu with more buttons. In the future I plan to fully finish the app and even add more ideas to it that I come up with in the future. In the end i want the app to be usable and helpful.</p>
